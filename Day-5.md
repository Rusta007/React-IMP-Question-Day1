# React Router

- React Router is a JavaScript framework that lets us handle client and server-side routing in React applications. 
- It enables the creation of single-page web or mobile apps that allow navigating without refreshing the page.
- It also allows us to use browser history features while preserving the right application view.
- Routing is a process in which a user is directed to different pages based on their action or request.
- ReactJS Router is mainly used for developing Single Page Web Applications. 
- React Router is used to define multiple routes in the application.
- When a user types a specific URL into the browser, and if this URL path matches any 'route' inside the router file, the user will be redirected to that particular route.

## React Router Installation
`$ npm install react-router-dom --save   `

### Adding React Router Components:
1. **BrowserRouter** : 
    - BrowserRouter is a router implementation that uses the HTML5 history API(pushState, replaceState and the popstate event) to keep your UI in sync with the URL. 
    - It is the parent component that is used to store all of the other components.
2. **Routes** :
    - Itâ€™s a new component introduced in the v6 and a upgrade of the component. 
    #### The main advantages of Routes over Switch are:
    - Routes are chosen based on the best match instead of being traversed in order.
3. **Route** :
     - Route is the conditionally shown component that renders some UI when its path matches the current URL.
4. **Link** :
    - Link component is used to create links to different routes and implement navigation around the application. 
    - It works like HTML anchor tag.

## Code

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router,Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './component/home';
import About from './component/about';
import Contact from './component/contact';
import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
render() {
	return (
	<Router>
		<div className="App">
			<ul className="App-header">
			<li>
				<Link to="/">Home</Link>
			</li>
			<li>
				<Link to="/about">About Us</Link>
			</li>
			<li>
				<Link to="/contact">Contact Us</Link>
			</li>
			</ul>
		<Routes>
				<Route exact path='/' element={< Home />}></Route>
				<Route exact path='/about' element={< About />}></Route>
				<Route exact path='/contact' element={< Contact />}></Route>
		</Routes>
		</div>
	</Router>
);
}
}

export default App;
```

## Outlet

```
An <Outlet> should be used in parent route elements to render their child route elements. 
This allows nested UI to show up when child routes are rendered. 
If the parent route matched exactly, it will render a child index route or nothing if there is no index route.
```

## Code:
```
import {
  BrowserRouter,
  Routes,
  Route,
  Link,
  Outlet
} from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="users" element={<Users />}>
          <Route path="/" element={<UsersIndex />} />
          <Route path=":id" element={<UserProfile />} />
          <Route path="me" element={<OwnUserProfile />} />
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

function Users() {
  return (
    <div>
      <nav>
        <Link to="me">My Profile</Link>
      </nav>

      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
}
```
